## Automatic Speech Recognition using DeepSpeech on Amazon SageMaker
**Speech Recognition** is the task of translating and converting spoken language into text. Audio data is virtually very difficult for computer systems to search and analyze. Therefore, recorded speech needs to be converted to text before it can be used in various different applications. Automatic Speech Recognition is the task of using deep supervised learning techniques to automatically and accurately convert speech into text. This code is an example of how to use DeepSpeech library [link] to prepare, build, train and host a model using Amazon SageMaker.

**DeepSpeech** is an open source Speech-To-Text engine based on Baiduâ€™s Deep Speech research [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5567.pdf) which implements the DeepSpeech architecture in Tensorflow.

## Data Preparation
WIP

## Building the Language Model
WIP

## Start Training
WIP

## Roadmap
- Build a SageMaker Inference (WIP)
- Include steps to optimize inference requests (tuning lm_alpha and lm_beta values involved in creating scorer) (WIP)
- Multi-instance GPU training (WIP)
- Support fine tuning.
- Support transfer learning.
- Add steps to create alphabet, vocab files for any language.
